# BiomechanicsToolbox

This script is written in Python using scipy and numpy stacks.

It provides a complete descrition of the human knee joint, including, muscles and bones in sagittal axe.

The biomechanics Toolbox model is build using a realistic data and provide a mathematical model of the knee joint.

HumanExoskeletonToolBox.py : provides the geometric models of the knee joint including :

* Quadriceps and Hamstrings muscle group lengths and moments arms

BiomechanicsToolBox.py : provides some Hill-Based muscle models including :

* Quadriceps and Hamstrings muscle group parameters (optimal length, tendon slack length, maximal isometric force, etc).
* EMG driven Hill-Based muscle models.

By using both above files, you can compute :

* individual muscle developped force and torque.
* The net knee joint developped torque and force.
